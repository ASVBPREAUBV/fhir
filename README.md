Intervention Engine FHIR Server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intervention-engine/fhir.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/intervention-engine/fhir)
===================================================================================================================================================================

This project provides [HL7 FHIR DSTU2](http://hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/index.html) models and a generic FHIR server implemented in Go and using MongoDB as storage. This is not a complete implementation, as it is tuned toward the primary use cases of the [Intervention Engine](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie) project.

Currently, this server supports:

-	JSON representations of all resources
-	Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) operations
-	Conditional update and delete
-	Some but not all search features
	-	All defined resource-specific search parameters except composite types and contact (email/phone) searches
	-	Chained searches
	-	\_include and \_revinclude searches (*without* \_recurse)
-	Batch bundle uploads (POST, PUT, and DELETE entries)

Currently, this server does *not* support the following major features:

-	XML representations of resources
-	History (versions, etc.)
-	Extension of primitive types and resource sub-components
-	Conformance statements

*NOTE: Most of the fhir source code is generated by the [fhir-golang-generator](https://github.com/intervention-engine/fhir-golang-generator). In most cases, updates to source code in the fhir repository need to be accompanied by corresponding updates in the fhir-golang-generator.*

Building and Running fhir Locally
---------------------------------

For information on installing and running the full Intervention Engine stack, please see [Building and Running the Intervention Engine Stack in a Development Environment](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie/blob/master/docs/dev_install.md).

For information on installing and running only the FHIR server, please begin by referencing the following sections of the above guide:

-	(Prerequisite) [Install Git](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie/blob/master/docs/dev_install.md#install-git)
-	(Prerequisite) [Install Go](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie/blob/master/docs/dev_install.md#install-go)
-	(Prerequisite) [Install MongoDB](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie/blob/master/docs/dev_install.md#install-mongodb)
-	(Prerequisite) [Run MongoDB](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie/blob/master/docs/dev_install.md#run-mongodb)
-	[Clone fhir Repository](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie/blob/master/docs/dev_install.md#clone-fhir-repository)

Before you can run the FHIR server, you must install its dependencies via `go get` and build the `fhir` executable:

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/intervention-engine/fhir
$ go build
```

The above commands do not need to be run again unless you make (or download) changes to the *fhir* source code.

Once the executable is built, you can run it without any arguments:

```
$ ./fhir
```

If you are concurrently modifying the *fhir* source code, sometimes it is easier to combine the build and run steps into a single command (forcing a recompile on every run):

```
$ go run server.go
```

The *fhir* server accepts connections on port 3001 by default.

If you wish to test the server with synthetic patient data, please reference [Generate and Upload Synthetic Patient Data](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie/blob/master/docs/dev_install.md#generate-and-upload-synthetic-patient-data).


Development
-----------

This project uses [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) to manage dependencies. It
also takes advantage of the /vendor directory support introduced in Go 1.6. To
properly run the test suite, execute the following command:

```
$ go test ./models ./search ./server ./upload
```

This will ensure that the vendor directory is not included when running the test
suite.

Testing Interceptors
--------------------

This server supports "interceptors", functions that allow interaction with resources before, after, and following a failed database operation. These are invoked at the data access layer. To test the interceptors:

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/intervention-engine/fhir/test
$ go build
$ ./test
```
This runs a testing variant of the fhir server with some test interceptors installed. Follow the testing instructions in `test/interceptor.go` to verify that the interceptors are working correctly.
